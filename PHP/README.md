#Backlog

[X] turn the admin php into a form to easily add and remove php
[] write the sql for each table (5 tables left)
[] change the password type to binary or something

### notes
* Ideally I'd want to make the value of the id `auto_increment` but then I don't also want it to start counting from record 0
* Do we have to put not null on a foreign key or doesn't the foreign key constraint take care of that already?
